Steps in video 1
1. Open QGIS project "Cadastral_data_BOG"
2. Load population table (population_upz_2015)
3. Create virtual colum with neighbourhoud ID (UPla)
4. Join Neighbourhoud layer and population table
5. Set Simbology for population density:
	Type: Centroid fill
	Color: #b08080 (close to transparent)
	Effect: Layer rendering / Feature / Overlay
6. Modify display for buildings layer (Cons0919)
7. Sum area of buildings per neighbourhood


Not seen in the video
1. Check geometry for buildings and get only the valid ones
2. Export centroids (Vector/Geometry Tools/Centroids)
3. Spatial Join between centroids and neighbourhoods (using only the code to attach to centroids)
4. Export as CSV (file: cons_upla)
